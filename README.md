# Git Configs

WARNING : currently under development, there is no published version

Manage and quickly setup different git configuration from command line. This tools is built for those who have to define different git identities depending on the repository. For example:
- repo A : identity 1
- repo B : identity 1
- repo C : identity 2
- repo D : identity 2

The command line allow you to define these identities and configuration only one time. You can then apply then to the relevant repositories.
